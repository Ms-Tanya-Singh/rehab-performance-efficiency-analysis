# Analyzing Score Efficiency in Therapeutic Games for Rehabilitation (Mock Data)

This project simulates and analyzes patient performance data from therapeutic game-based rehabilitation sessions. It focuses on time-normalized scoring efficiency, patient classification based on mobility, and game difficulty. The goal is to illustrate how data-driven insights can be used to understand and improve rehabilitation outcomes.

**Note:** This project uses mock data to demonstrate the approach. No real patient information is included.

## What Is Measured?

- **Score per Minute**: A normalized performance metric defined as `score / game_duration`, which helps compare efficiency regardless of session length.
- **Patient Classification**: Patients are categorized into High, Low, or No mobility groups based on their range of motion (ROM).
- **Game Difficulty**: Each game is mapped to a difficulty level (easy to hard) using a lookup table.

## Project Features

- Time-normalized scoring analysis using `score_per_minute`
- Outlier filtering with Interquartile Range (IQR)
- Performance comparisons across patient mobility levels
- Game-type and difficulty analysis
- Use of colormaps in visualizations for intuitive trends

This project demonstrates how combining basic statistical filtering, domain knowledge, and visual storytelling can uncover meaningful trends in therapeutic game data — even when starting with mock data.
